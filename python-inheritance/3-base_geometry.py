    An empty base class for representing geometric entities.

    This class serves as a base class that other classes can inherit from to
    define specific geometric entities and their behavior.

        None

    Example:
        # Create an instance of the BaseGeometry class

        # Print the object representation and attributes of the instance
        print(bg)
